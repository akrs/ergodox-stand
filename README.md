## Fork info

I (bchociej) forked this repo from [adereth/ergodox-tent](https://github.com/adereth/ergodox-tent) with the intention of implementing new features, including tilting, native millimeter dimensions, and full-hand version.

# ergodox-tent

A tent for the [Ergodox acrylic case designed by Litster](http://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox).  The design was implemented using [clj-scad](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj).

## Usage

If you're just interested in printing your own, just download [resources/tent.stl](resources/tent.stl) and feed it into your favorite software for 3D printing.

If you'd like to contribute, I'd prefer you make changes to the original Clojure source.  I've also included the [generated SCAD](resources/tent.scad) if you want to experiment and don't have a Clojure environment set up.
